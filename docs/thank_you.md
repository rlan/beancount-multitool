# Thank you

This project is not possible without the people behind the various tools on my tech stack.

* The financial [institutions](institutions/index.md) which make data available via CSV files.
* [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) for plain-text accounting.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting source code, CI/CD and documentation.
* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for hosting releases.
* Various Python tools: [click][], [pandas][], [pipx][], [poetry][], [pyenv][], [pytest][], [pytest-cov][], [ruff][].
* [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for writing documentation.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the IDE.
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for the package manager.
